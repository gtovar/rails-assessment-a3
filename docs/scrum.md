# Scrum plan (lightweight)

## Goal
Deliver the A3 assessment with clear scope, tests, and documentation.

## Backlog (user stories)
- CRUD invoices
- Filtered list (status, emitter, receiver, amount range)
- Received invoices by emitter (emitted_at filter + total)
- Bulk XML import (ZIP)
- QR endpoint for `cfdi_digital_stamp`

## Sprint structure
- Sprint length: 1 week (or shorter if needed)
- Daily check-in: 5 minutes (what I did, what I will do, blockers)

## Sprint 1 (proposed)
- Story 1: Model + migration
- Story 2: CRUD + filters
- Story 3: Import ZIP + QR
- Story 4: Tests + docs

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- Feature works end-to-end
- Tests cover the feature
- Docs updated (API_REFERENCE / README if needed)
- No critical lint errors
